    <h2>So... This is it:</h2>
    <p>I couldn't figure out how to insert multiple JS canvases into one webpage, so Instead, there will be a ton of links referencing each one.<br> ... Here we go</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Khan Academy shit</h3>
    <h4>Fish tank</h4>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-fish-tank/4588322378514432">https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-fish-tank</a>
    <p>simple mouse folower, but only following at a percent of the distance. </p>

    <h4>Food Thing</h4>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-whats-for-dinner/5662681952190464">https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-whats-for-dinner</a>
    <p>simple visual program utilising javascript. No real purpose.</p>


    <h4>Book Thing</h4>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-bookshelf/6274229330935808">https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-bookshelf</a>
    <p>simple visual program using javascript. No real purpose.</p>

    <h4>Ad Design</h4>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-ad-design/5875538039963648">https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-ad-design</a>
    <p>Yet another simple program with no real purpose. use a graphical program nexxt time.</p>

    <h4>Memory</h4>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-memory/4909623935139840">https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-memory</a>
    <p>something with a minor purpose - uses variables (ooh shiny) </p>

    <h4>bad spaceship thing</h4>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-asteroids-spaceship/4782128289497088">https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-asteroids-spaceship</a>
    <p>uses some quite complex math to create a spaceship with turning controls and a forwards thrust.</p>

    <h4>Mountain Range</h4>
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-mountain-range/5337998698168320">https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-mountain-range</a>
    <p>Khan academy dosen't do it justice. using noise and other complex random numbers (which aren't random on Kahn academy) generates a visual mountain range, with background effects. </p>

    <h3>Non Kahn Academy stuff.</h3>
    <h4>Game of life</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/Rookitmin/GameOfLife">https://github.com/Rookitmin/GameOfLife</a>
    <p>making the game of life with a variation. there is definitly a better way to do this.</p>

    <h4>Hockey thing</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/Rookitmin/ICS2O.SUM.RD.BM.AHA">https://github.com/Rookitmin/ICS2O.SUM.RD.BM.AHA</a>
    <p>First real Project with a group. We made a program from scratch, that attempted to be a simple Hockey based game. It was about as complex as grade 10's could make it</p>

    <h4>Exception Boss</h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/Rookitmin/exception-boss">https://github.com/Rookitmin/exception-boss</a>
    <p>Something I started working on in my spare time. an Undertale based Bosfight, for one of my friend's overpowered charecters. one of the few things here that I actually enjoyed doing.</p>
